# Mario-Game-
I built a 2 level Mario Game in JavaScript using the Kaboom.js library. 
This is the first time I utilized a library in a project. 

Bugs:
1. I recieved a warning that my Label was not defined
2. My dangerous mushrooms would not move

How I solved these bugs:
1. I realized that I spelled label wrong lol 
2. I realized when I first labelled the mushrooms as 'danger' and later referenced them to 'dangerous'
  so I went back and made sure that both labels were consistent and both were labelled 'dangerous'.
 
What I learned:
  Both were simple fixed that taught me to check my work as I build my project, as well as, to pay 
  attention to the details.
